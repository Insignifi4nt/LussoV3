# Lusso Restaurant - Ultra-Modular Design System

A luxury restaurant website built with cutting-edge technology and an ultra-modular design system architecture, optimized for static hosting and mobile-first experiences.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The Lusso restaurant website is a luxury dining web experience built with an **ultra-modular design system architecture**. We've moved beyond planning into a sophisticated foundation that's ready for restaurant-specific component development.

## 📊 Current Project Status

**Status**: ✅ **Project Complete** - Design system foundation, GitHub Pages deployment, and ultra-modular architecture fully implemented.

## 🏗️ Architecture Foundation

### **Current Status: ✅ Complete Implementation**

We've successfully built and deployed a comprehensive ultra-modular design system with GitHub Pages integration:

- **🎨 Theme System**: 2 complete themes (Light, Dark) with seamless switching
- **📝 Typography**: Complete font system (DM Serif Display + Inter) with optimized design tokens
- **🎡 Color Tokens**: Semantic color system supporting unlimited theme variations
- **📏 Design Tokens**: Complete spacing, animation, and layout system
- **🔧 Component Architecture**: Type-safe, accessible component system ready for restaurant features

## 💻 Technology Stack

### **Core Framework**
- **Next.js 15.3.5** - App Router with static export optimization
- **React 19** - Latest React with enhanced server components
- **TypeScript 5** - Full type safety throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Next-generation utility framework with CSS custom properties

### **Design System**
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Native theme switching with minimal JavaScript overhead
- **shadcn/ui Integration** - High-quality, accessible component foundation
- **Design Token Architecture** - Semantic color, spacing, and typography systems
- **Fluid Typography** - Responsive text scaling using CSS clamp functions

### **Developer Experience**
- **Ultra-Modular Components** - Easy to customize, swap, and extend
- **Theme Provider System** - Seamless theme switching with localStorage persistence
- **Component Research** - Comprehensive library of restaurant-specific components
- **Type-Safe Design Tokens** - Full TypeScript support for design system

## 🎨 Design System Features

Our ultra-modular design system provides theme-aware components that automatically adapt using CSS custom properties, enabling seamless switching between Light and Dark themes. Most components use pure CSS with zero JavaScript overhead, with the aurora background component using minimal JavaScript for advanced theme integration.

### **Theme Switching Architecture**
- **CSS-Based (Most Components)**: Header, buttons, text, backgrounds use pure CSS custom properties
- **JavaScript-Enhanced (Aurora Only)**: Aurora background uses DOM-based theme detection for reliable color switching
- **Static Export Compatible**: All functionality works on GitHub Pages and static hosting
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - only aurora component uses JavaScript theme detection
