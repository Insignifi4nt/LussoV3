# Lessons Learned: Next.js 15 + React 19 Restaurant Website Foundation

## Overview
This document captures key insights, challenges, and best practices discovered during the establishment of a modular architecture foundation for the Lusso restaurant website using Next.js 15 with React 19. The goal was to create an error-minimized development environment for a non-technical developer.

## 1. Next.js 15 + React 19 Compatibility

### What Works Well
- **Server Components by Default**: The new architecture where components are server-rendered by default provides excellent performance
- **Improved Hydration**: React 19's concurrent features work seamlessly with Next.js 15's SSR
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better error messages and debugging capabilities
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic code splitting and tree shaking work more effectively

### What Doesn't Work
- **Legacy Libraries**: Some older React libraries may not be compatible with React 19's new patterns
- **Class Components**: Limited support for legacy class component patterns
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Some packages require updates to work with the new architecture

### Recommendations
- Always check library compatibility before adding dependencies
- Prefer function components with hooks over class components
- Test thoroughly when upgrading existing projects
- Keep dependencies updated to their latest versions

## 2. Server vs Client Components: Best Practices for Boundaries

### Server Component Best Practices
- **Use for Data Fetching**: Ideal for components that fetch data at build/request time
- **Static Content**: Perfect for headers, footers, and content that doesn't require interactivity
- **SEO-Critical Content**: Use for content that needs to be indexed by search engines
- **Database Queries**: Direct database access without API layers

### Client Component Best Practices
- **Interactive Elements**: Required for forms, buttons with event handlers, state management
- **Browser APIs**: When accessing localStorage, sessionStorage, or browser-specific features
- **Real-time Updates**: For components that need to update based on user interactions
- **Third-party Interactive Libraries**: Most UI libraries require client-side rendering

### Boundary Guidelines
```typescript
// Good: Clear separation for restaurant website
'use client'  // Only when absolutely necessary
import { useState } from 'react'

// Server component fetches restaurant data
async function MenuItemList() {
  const menuItems = await fetchMenuItems()
  return (
    <div>
      {menuItems.map(item => (
        <MenuItemCard key={item.id} item={item} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

// Client component handles restaurant ordering interactivity
'use client'
function AddToOrderButton({ menuItemId }: { menuItemId: string }) {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
  // Interactive logic for restaurant ordering
}
```

### Recommendations
- Start with server components by default
- Only add 'use client' when interaction is required
- Keep client components as small and focused as possible
- Pass data down from server to client components via props

## 3. Turbopack Limitations

### When to Use Turbopack
- **Development Environment**: Excellent for fast development builds
- **Small to Medium Projects**: Works well for projects with straightforward build requirements
- **Standard Next.js Features**: Great compatibility with built-in Next.js functionality

### When to Avoid Turbopack
- **Complex Build Configurations**: May not support all custom webpack configurations
- **Legacy Dependencies**: Some older packages may not work correctly
- **Custom Loaders**: Limited support for complex webpack loaders
- **Production Builds**: Still experimental for production use

### Current Limitations Observed
- Some third-party libraries may not bundle correctly
- Custom webpack configurations may not be fully supported
- Debugging can be more challenging than with standard webpack

### Recommendations
- Use Turbopack for development speed, but test thoroughly
- Keep webpack as fallback for complex builds
- Monitor Turbopack updates for production readiness
- Test all dependencies work correctly with Turbopack

## 4. Barrel Exports: Pros and Cons with Modern Next.js

### Pros
- **Clean Imports**: `import { Button, Card } from '@/components'`
- **Better Organization**: Central export point for related components
- **Easier Refactoring**: Changes to internal structure don't affect imports

### Cons with Next.js 15
- **Bundle Size Impact**: May prevent optimal tree shaking
- **Development Performance**: Can slow down development builds
- **Circular Dependency Risk**: Easier to create circular imports
- **Server/Client Boundary Issues**: Can accidentally mix server and client components

### Example Issues Encountered
```typescript
// Problematic: Mixing server and client in barrel export
export { Header } from './header'        // Restaurant header (server)
export { ContactForm } from './contact-form'  // Restaurant contact (client)

// Better: Separate barrels for restaurant components
// server-components/index.ts
export { Header } from './header'
export { MenuItemCard } from './menu-item-card'

// client-components/index.ts  
export { ContactForm } from './contact-form'
export { ReservationForm } from './reservation-form'
```

### Recommendations
- Use barrel exports sparingly with Next.js 15
- Separate server and client component exports
- Prefer direct imports for better tree shaking
- Monitor bundle size when using barrel exports

## 5. Server Actions: Benefits over Client-Side Event Handlers

### Key Benefits
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Forms work without JavaScript
- **Better Performance**: No client-side JavaScript needed for form submissions
- **Improved Security**: Server-side validation and processing
- **Simplified Data Flow**: Direct server communication without API routes

### Implementation Best Practices
```typescript
// Server action for restaurant
export async function submitContactForm(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'
  
  const email = formData.get('email') as string
  const message = formData.get('message') as string
  
  // Server-side validation and processing for restaurant
  // Direct database operations (customer inquiries)
  // Email sending to restaurant management, etc.
}

// Component usage for restaurant contact
function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <form action={submitContactForm}>
      <input name="email" type="email" required />
      <textarea name="message" placeholder="Questions about catering, reservations, etc." required />
      <button type="submit">Contact Restaurant</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### When to Use Server Actions
- Form submissions and data mutations
- File uploads and processing
- Email sending and external API calls
- Database operations

### When to Use Client Handlers
- Immediate UI feedback and animations
- Local state updates
- Browser API interactions
- Real-time features

### Recommendations
- Prefer server actions for data mutations
- Combine with client components for enhanced UX
- Use proper error handling and validation
- Implement loading states for better user experience

## 6. TypeScript Module Issues: How Empty Files Can Break Builds

### The Problem
Empty TypeScript files or files with only type exports can cause module resolution issues in Next.js 15, leading to build failures or runtime errors.

### Examples of Problematic Files
```typescript
// Empty index.ts file
// This can break imports

// Type-only file without proper exports
export type { SomeType } from './types'
// Missing runtime export can cause issues
```

### Solutions Implemented
```typescript
// Better: Ensure all barrel exports have runtime exports (restaurant components)
export { Button } from './button'
export { MenuItemCard } from './menu-item-card'
export { ReservationForm } from './reservation-form'
export type { MenuItemProps, ReservationProps } from './types'

// Or use explicit type-only imports
export type * from './types'
```

### Recommendations
- Avoid completely empty TypeScript files
- Ensure barrel exports include runtime exports
- Use explicit type imports/exports when needed
- Regularly audit for unused or problematic files

## 7. Debugging Strategies: How to Diagnose Client Component Errors

### Common Error Patterns
1. **Hydration Mismatches**: Server and client render differently
2. **'use client' Missing**: Interactive features not working
3. **Import Errors**: Mixing server and client components incorrectly

### Debugging Techniques

#### 1. Hydration Issues
```typescript
// Add key prop to help React reconcile
<Component key={uniqueKey} />

// Use useEffect for client-only code
useEffect(() => {
  // Client-only logic here
}, [])
```

#### 2. Component Boundary Issues
```bash
# Check if component needs 'use client'
# Look for these patterns:
- useState, useEffect, useCallback
- Event handlers (onClick, onSubmit)
- Browser APIs (localStorage, document, window)
```

#### 3. Build Time Debugging
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
npm run build -- --debug

# Check bundle analysis
npm run build && npm run analyze
```

### Debugging Tools
- **React Developer Tools**: Essential for component inspection
- **Next.js Built-in Logging**: Use console.log strategically
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Catches many issues early
- **ESLint Rules**: Custom rules for server/client boundaries

### Recommendations
- Enable strict TypeScript checking
- Use React Developer Tools extensively
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Add logging for server actions and data flows
- Test components in isolation when possible
