# LussoV3 Project Rundown
*Understanding What's Currently Set Up*

## What Is This Project?

LussoV3 is the beginning of a new version of the Lusso restaurant website. Think of it like having **architectural blueprints and a prepared construction site, but no actual building yet**. The planning is detailed and professional, but the actual restaurant website hasn't been built.

---

## The Big Picture

**Current Status**: Fresh starting point with excellent planning  
**Goal**: Build a luxury restaurant website that works great on phones and costs less to run  
**Approach**: Static website (faster, cheaper) instead of dynamic website (slower, more expensive)

---

## What's In The Project Right Now

### 📁 **Main Folders & What They Do**

```
LussoV3/
└── lusso-static/          ← The actual project lives here
    ├── src/app/           ← Where the website pages will be built
    ├── public/            ← Where images and files visitors can see go
    ├── node_modules/      ← Software libraries (like a toolbox)
    └── Configuration files ← Settings that tell the computer how to work
```

### 🏗️ **The Foundation (What's Set Up)**

**Think of this like having:**
- A construction site cleared and ready
- All the tools delivered and organized
- Detailed blueprints approved
- Building permits approved
- **But no actual construction started yet**

### 📋 **Configuration Files (The "Settings")**

These are like instruction manuals that tell the computer how to build your website:

**package.json** - *The Shopping List*
- Lists all the software tools needed (like React, Next.js, Tailwind)
- Uses the newest, most modern versions available
- Includes commands to start building, testing, and launching the site

**next.config.ts** - *The Build Instructions*
- Currently empty (needs to be filled in)
- Will tell the computer how to create the final website files
- Missing the "make it static" instruction needed for cheap hosting

**tsconfig.json** - *The Quality Control Rules*
- Makes sure the code is written correctly
- Catches mistakes before they become problems
- Set up for strict quality standards

**Other configs** - *Specialized Tools*
- ESLint: Checks code quality automatically
- PostCSS: Processes the visual styling
- Tailwind: Handles the website's appearance

## What's Actually Built vs. What's Just Placeholder

### ✅ **What's Ready To Use**

1. **Modern Foundation**
   - Next.js 15 (the framework - think "website building system")
   - React 19 (the user interface system - very latest version)
   - TypeScript (catches coding mistakes automatically)
   - Tailwind CSS (makes styling easier and more consistent)

2. **Development Environment**
   - Fast development server (see changes instantly)
   - Automatic error checking
   - Modern build tools (Turbopack - faster than old systems)

3. **Quality Controls**
   - Code checking tools
   - Error detection systems
   - Professional development standards

### ❌ **What's Still Missing (Everything Lusso-Specific)**

1. **No Restaurant Content**
   - No Lusso branding or colors
   - No menu system
   - No reservation forms
   - No restaurant story or information

2. **No Custom Design**
   - Still shows default "Welcome to Next.js" page
   - No luxury gold/navy color scheme
   - No elegant fonts (Playfair Display, Lato)
   - No mobile-optimized layouts

3. **No Restaurant Features**
   - No menu categories or food items
   - No contact forms
   - No photo galleries
   - No section navigation (Hero, Story, Menu, Contact)

## The Master Plan (PRD.md)

The most valuable thing in the project right now is **PRD.md** - a detailed 339-line document that's like a master architect's blueprint.

### What This Document Contains:

**🎯 Clear Goals**
- Make the site work great on phones
- Reduce hosting costs by 80%+
- Keep the luxury look and feel
- Load in under 2 seconds

**🏗️ Technical Architecture**
- Exactly which components need to be built
- How the navigation should work
- Where each type of file should go
- Performance requirements

**📱 Mobile-First Approach**
- Touch-friendly design
- Swipe gestures
- Phone-optimized layouts
- Fast loading on slow connections

**📋 5-Phase Implementation Plan**
1. **Phase 1**: Set up the foundation (partially done)
2. **Phase 2**: Build the components (Hero, Menu, Contact sections)
3. **Phase 3**: Add all the content and images
4. **Phase 4**: Perfect the mobile experience
5. **Phase 5**: Launch the website

## Current File Structure Explained

### **src/app/** - *The Website Pages*
- `layout.tsx`: The wrapper that goes around every page
- `page.tsx`: The homepage (currently just a placeholder)
- `globals.css`: Website-wide styling rules
- `favicon.ico`: The little icon that shows in browser tabs

### **public/** - *Visitor-Accessible Files*
- Currently just has default Next.js logo files
- This is where restaurant photos, menu images, etc. will go

### **Configuration Files** - *Behind-the-Scenes Settings*
- Multiple files that tell the computer how to build and run the site
- All properly configured for modern development
- Ready for luxury restaurant website development

## Technology Stack (In Simple Terms)

**Next.js 15** - *The Website Building System*
- Like having a professional construction crew
- Handles all the complex technical stuff automatically
- Makes websites fast and search-engine friendly

**React 19** - *The User Interface System*
- Makes interactive elements work smoothly
- Latest version with newest features
- Industry standard for modern websites

**Tailwind CSS v4** - *The Design System*
- Like having a professional interior designer's toolkit
- Makes consistent, beautiful styling easier
- Latest major version (just released)

**TypeScript 5** - *The Quality Assurance System*
- Catches mistakes before they cause problems
- Makes the code more reliable and professional
- Like having a proofreader for code

## What This Means For Next Steps

**Current State**: Professional foundation ready for development  
**Next Step**: Begin Phase 1 development (basic infrastructure)  
**Priority**: Transform the placeholder content into Lusso restaurant content

**Think of it this way**: You have a professional kitchen fully equipped with the best tools, detailed recipes, and a clear plan - now you need to start cooking the actual meal.

The project is perfectly positioned to begin building the luxury restaurant website according to the comprehensive specifications in the PRD document.
