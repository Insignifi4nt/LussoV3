# Liquid Glass Header Update

This update enhances the `Header` component with visual effects inspired by Apple's upcoming "liquid glass" style.

## Key changes
- Added dynamic lighting using CSS custom properties updated on mouse movement.
- Boosted backdrop vibrancy via `saturate(1.8)`.
- Introduced a subtle noise texture and moving radial sheen overlay.
- Included fallback styles for dark theme.
- Adjusted base transparency so background content remains visible.

These improvements aim to make the header feel more physical and interactive than basic glassmorphism.
